                <h3>MotoVox MBX10 (Custom)</h3>
                <img src="images/motovox2.jpeg" style="max-width: 49%; height: auto;">
                <p>Last summer I was extremely bored so I decided to build this from scratch. It was a little project of mine that took a couple of days to finish.</p>
                <p>Parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Predator 224cc</li>
                    <li>Tires</li>
                    <li>Centrifugal Clutch</li>
                    <li>Sprocket</li>
                    <li>#35 Chain</li>
                    <li>Chain Guard</li>
                    <li>Center Rear Exhaust</li>
                    <li>Carburetor</li>
                    <li>Brake Lever</li>
                    <li>Red Grips and Throttle</li>
                    <li>Seat</li>
                    <li>Kill Switch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This was such a fun first build. It took a while to create it as I was buying and returning parts. With trial and error I finally figured it out. I ended up selling it and made extraordinary profit.</p>

                <h3>Coleman CT200u (Custom)</h3>
                <img src="images/coleman.JPG" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;">
                <p>After I built the Motovox, my friend wanted to build another bike with him.</p>
                <p>Parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Predator 212cc</li>
                    <li>Tires</li>
                    <li>Centrifugal Clutch</li>
                    <li>Sprocket</li>
                    <li>#40 Chain</li>
                    <li>Chain Guard</li>
                    <li>Exhaust</li>
                    <li>Carburetor</li>
                    <li>Brake Lever</li>
                    <li>Black Grips and Throttle</li>
                    <li>Metal Fender</li>
                    <li>Headlight</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This was pretty straight forward. I am trying to convince my friend at get it DMV approved by adding a title to it. All he would have to is add turn signal lights and get PENNDOT approved tires.</p>

                <h3>Tao Tao Quad (Custom)</h3>
                <img src="images/firstquad2.jpg" style="max-width: 49%; height: auto;">
                <img src="images/firstquad.jpg" style="max-width: 49%; height: auto;">
                <p>Those two bikes were completed in less than two weeks. It was a fun hobby so I was always scouting Facebook Marketplace and came upon this quad. I was willing to tackle on something a little different and having a quad would be sick.</p>
                <p>Parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Predator 212cc</li>
                    <li>Torque Converter</li>
                    <li>Exhaust</li>
                    <li>Carburetor</li>
                    <li>Drum Brakes</li>
                    <li>Hydraulic Brakes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The hardest part was adding the torque converter because I tried to straight chain it with a ordinary centrifugal clutch. ATV's won't allow that due to the four tires need more torque.</p>

                <p>&nbsp</p>

                <h3>Tao Tao Quad (Current Build)</h3>
                <img src="images/mini_quad.jpeg" style="max-width: 49%; height: auto;">
                <p>Facebook marketplace always has steals. This guy sold me this quad for only $100 because he didn't know to put on the tires on the rims.</p>
                <p>Parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Battery</li>
                    <li>Hydraulic Brake</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I am still working on this but I have a buyer that is paying me $500 to finish it.</p>

                <h>&nbsp</h>

                <h3>Mid Sized ATV (Current Build)</h3>
                <img src="images/atv.jpeg" style="max-width: 49%; height: auto;">
                <p>This is going to be such an interesting build. It might look small but this frame is huge. I am in the process of learning how to weld and am considering take apart the entire frame to perfect the build.</p>
                <p>Parts needed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Engine?????? Might get a 420cc or 301cc Predator engine</li>
                    <li>Mounting Bracket</li>
                    <li>#530 Motorcycle Chain</li>
                    <li>Carburetor</li>
                    <li>Torque Converter</li>
                    <li>Hydraulic Brakes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a very experimental build and I look forward to adding a title to it. Driving on the road legally would be very fun and I could drive to work in swag. ðŸ˜Ž</p>
